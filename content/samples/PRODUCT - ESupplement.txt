This PRODUCT block is an example of a how a GAO Esupplement product
is created and the statements generally used on the background statement
that will appear on the home page. The Esupplement product files may
be created once a PRODUCT block has been added to your QPL program.
In this case, the questionnaire and associated statistical results

This e-supplement is a companion to our review of the Agriculture 
Quarantine Inspection (AQI) program. The AQI program used to be 
managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), but since 
February 2003 the program has been jointly managed by USDA and the 
Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP). The purpose of this e-supplement is to provide information from 
a Web-based survey designed to obtain perspectives on the AQI program 
from agriculture specialists and supervisors at CBP, including 
agriculture canine handlers.

This survey is similar to one we conducted in 2006. The survey was 
administered to individuals engaged in agricultural inspection duties 
as of October 2011 and still engaged in this duty as of February 2012. 
We received an un-weighted response rate of 74 percent. A copy of the 
survey is reproduced in this e-supplement, along with summary 
statistics. We excluded responses to most open-ended narrative 
questions. See the full report (GAO-12-885) for a more detailed 
discussion of our scope and methodology.

For key questions, this e-supplement presents the overall weighted 
survey percentages for Agricultural Specialists, Canine Handlers, and 
Supervisory Agricultural Specialists individually and combined. For 
those key questions, this e-supplement also presents the weighted 
survey percentages for respondents who had formerly worked for USDA 
(known as Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Officers) and those 
hired after 2003. In this e-supplement, those employees hired prior to 
2003 are also referred to as "Former PPQ Officers." 

We conducted our work from August 2011 to July 2012 in accordance with 
generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, 
appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings 
and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the 
evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and 
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
