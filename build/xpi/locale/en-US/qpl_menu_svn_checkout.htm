	<h1>Get QPL Project Files From Version Control</h2>

	<p>This dialog lets you copy a new or existing QPL project from your
	version control repository to the local working directory on your computer
	where you may edit your questionnaire program, compile it to create your
	web site files, and then view your changes.</p>
	
	<p>Your working directory should have been set in your QPL Preferences when
	you first installed this Komodo Add-on. The current location is shown at
	the bottom of this dialog.</p>
	
	<p>Project names listed in bold type exist in the repository, but have not
	yet been copied (i.e., checked-out) to your local working folder. These are
	projects that usually have been created by another questionnaire developer.
	If you delete your local working folder, your project will still exist in the
	repository and will be listed here in bold. You may re-create your local project
	by using this dialog to copy it back to your local working directory.</p>
	
	<p>Project names listed in normal type also exist in your working directory.
	Selecting one of these projects will update your local files with any changes
	from the repository (including any changes that have been made to any files, plus
	copying any new files that may have been added to the repository. (Note: Files may
	also be removed from your working directory if they have been removed from the
	respository.)</p>
	
	<p>After your local files have been updated, the QPL
	source program file (.pg6) will be opened in a Komodo editing window,
	and the copy in the version control respository will be locked so that other users
	can not make changes to it while you are working on it. (Note: If it is a multi-language
	QPL project, all of the source program file translations will be opened in
	separate Komodo editing tabs.)</p>
	
	<p><b>Important!</b> You should always "Send" your project files back to the version
	control repository when you finished your editing session by using the QPL "Send
	project files to version control" command. This will save all your your changes
	in the repository as a new version of your project and unlock your source QPL program
	file so that it may be edited by someone else. When you are ready for your project
	to be deployed to a web server, your project files will be taken from the respository
	so these files must be up-to-date!</p>

	<h2>Select Project</h2>
	
	<p>Highlight a project and then click the "Get" button to copy the project repository
	files to your local working directory.</p>

	
	<h3>Project</h3>
	<p>This is the short name of the project in the respository and the name of your
	local working directory.</p>
	
	<h3>Committer</h3>
	<p>This is the network user name of the last person to send updated files to this
	repository.</p>
	
	<h3>When</h3>
	<p>This is the date and time when the project was lasted updated.</p>
	
	<h3>Revision</h3>
	<p>This is the version control system's internal revision number for the last
	collection of changes. The revision numbering is used across all of the QPL projects
	in the repository and so does not indicate the number of changes that have been
	made to your project. The revision number can be used in special circumstances
	to uniquely identify a previous version of your project and, if necessary, roll-back
	any changes that were made.</p>
