	<h1>Build Local Web Site Files</h1>

	<p>This dialog is used to build a version of your questionnaire web site that you
	view on your computer with a browsers. This lets you quickly see how your project
	will look to a respondent after it has been installed on a web server. Much of
	the functionality, thought not all, will be available for testing such as links
	that skip you to a section in the questionnaire from the menu, links that skip you
	to a particular question, or display a question (or group of questions) according
	to a particular response to a question. This lets you quickly cycle through the
	edit, build, view steps when creating your questionnaire form.</p>
	
	<p>Some of the functionality is not available locally. If your questionnaire
	has multiple pages, then all of the pages will be displayed 
	in one browser window with the page breaks shown as thick, horizontal lines.
	And since there is no database underpinning the local web page, you may enter
	data on the page but it is not stored anywhere.</p>
	
	<p>The options on this dialog let create technical documentation of your
	questionnaire by labeling the questions with the database field names and
	other information that will be useful later when performing a statistical
	analysis of your questionnaire results. It is often useful to print the
	technical rendering of your questionnaire as an Adobe PDF file for your
	own reference or to include in your documentation package for your data
	analyst.</p>
	
	<p>If you are creating a mult-language project, each of the language-specific
	QPL program (.pg6) files will be listed with selected check-boxes. The QPL
	compiler will compile each the program files listed unless you uncheck
	its checkbox. (Note: If you are using the INCLUDE command to merge one
	or more questionnaire program files into one master file, then you should
	un-check the included files. The QPL compiler will automatically use them
	when it reads the INCLUDE command.)</p>
	
	<p>Click the Build button to compile your questionnaire program into a local
	version of your web site. The Command Output pane will list any programming syntax
	errors that occurred which prevented the QPL compiler from creating the web
	site. (Note: To show the Komodo Command Output pane, use View &gt; Tabs &amp; Sidebars
	&gt; Command Output.) You may need to scroll back through the information in this
	pane to see all of the syntax error or warning information.</p>

	<p>If your questionnaire program compiles without errors, then your project
	home page will be displayed in a new browser tab in Komodo. (You should still
	review the Command Output pane for any warning messages that you may want
	to correct.) Click on the "Begin" button to open your questionnaire in a new
	browser window. Here you may click on the various links to exercise the
	web form. Click on the Print button at the bottom of the form to print it.
	Click on the Exit or Submit button to close the browser window. You may go
	back to your questionnaire program (.pg6) file to make more changes and
	then repeat this process to view the results.</p>
	
	<h2>Include Variable Names on Web Form</h2>
	<p>Checking this option will cause the local HTML version of your questionnaire
	program to be created with each question's database field name being displayed
	on the form in red italics. These are the names that are used in the MySQL "data'
	table that is created to support the questionnaire when it is installed on
	a web server, and the names that will be used when the data is exported for
	analysis with a spreadsheet or with the SAS or SPSS statistical analysis
	programs.</p>
	
	<h2>Show Any Hidden Questions</h2>
	<p>QPL includes programming syntax that lets you conditionally link the answer
	to a multiple choice question to the visual display of one or more other questions.
	This is programmed using the DISPLAY command.
	For example, if a respondent selected "Yes," as an answer to a multiple choice
	question, then a follow-up question could be programmed to suddenly appear on the web
	page. Clicking "No" could make it dissappear. While this helps direct respondents
	to relevant lines of questions, it prevents you from printing a copy of your
	web form that includes all of your questions. Checking this option overides
	any DISPLAY command logic in your program to show all of the questions.</p>
	
	<h2>Show Any Hidden Questions With DISPLAY Information</h2>
	<p>This option overides any DISPLAY command logic to show all of the questions,
	just like the previous option. In addition to this, the
	DISPLAY trigger names are labeled on answers to multiple choice questions, and the
	target questions are labeled with the trigger name. A box is drawn around all
	the questions that are included in each DISPLAY target.</p>
