	<h1>Send Project Files to Version Control</h2>

	<p>This dialog is used to copy your project files back to your Subversion repository and
	unlock your QPL program (.pg6).</p>
	
	<p>Changes to your QPL source program will be automatically stored there as a new version,
	and any new files you have created will be automatically added to the repository. The copy
	of your source QPL program file will be unlocked in the repository so that be checked
	out and edited by someone else. You also will need to use the QPL "Get" command to get the
	files from the repository before you may make more changes to your program.</p>
	
	<h2>Log Entry</h2>
	<p>You may attach a short comment to label this version of your project. This can be especially
	useful if you have reached some particular milestone in the development of your project, or have
	made other significant changes, that you may want to track in the repository. For example, if
	you later find you want to roll-back your project files to an earlier version, having a label
	that you attached to the revision will make it much easier for you to identify the particular
	version you want. Usually, just a few words are sufficient for a usable label (ex. "Added questions
	about the state's role on compliance monitoring.")</p>
