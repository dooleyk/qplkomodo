	<h1>QPL 6 Preferences</h2>

	<p>These preferences tell the QPL development system about how the resources it
	needs are set up on your computer. These should be set when you first install
	the QPL Add-on in Komodo. The QPL development system will continue to use these
	settings every time you start Komodo. And the settings will be retained when
	you upgrade the QPL Add-on software.</p>
	
	<p>At a minimum, you must set the Operating System and Working Directory
	preferences in order to be able to create, compile, and review QPL projects.</p>
	
	<p>You may optionally use the Subversion (version control) and JobTracker (project tracking)
	settings if they are used by your questionnaire development team. (Note: JobTracker is local
	only to GAO and has not been publicly released.)</p>
	
	<h2>Operating System</h2>
	<p>This setting defaults to Windows 32, which should work for all versions of Windows
	that have been released since Windows XP. If you have installed Komodo and this Add-on
	on a computer using another OS, then select that option.</p>
	
	<p>Click the "Test QPL Software
	Connection" button to confirm that the software is working. Open the "Command Output"
	pane at the bottom Komodo window to see the results of the test (View &gt; Tabs &amp; Sidebars &gt;
	Command Output). The test runs the QPL program compiler to show its command line options.
	If successful, "OK," will be displayed near the top of the Command Output pane.</p>

	<h2>Subversion Repository</h2>
	<p>If you have are using the the Subversion version control system to back-up your
	QPL projects, enter the location of your repository here. The location must be prefaced
	with the transfer protocol (i.e., http://, https://, file://, or svn://). If you are
	not using a Subversion repository, then leave this field blank. (Note: The "file://" pathway
	should always start with a slash for the root directory in addition to the two slashes
	that are used to indicate the protocol, even if you are using Windows. <br />
	(Ex. <span style="font-family: monospace;">file:///C:\Users\dooleyk\svnrepo</span> )</p>
	
	<p>The "Test" button will run the Subversion command to list the projects that
	are located in your repository. When you click the "Test" button, a dialog is displayed
	that asks for your repository user name and password. Fill in this information as
	required by your repository administrator. The user name and password you enter here
	will be used for your later work when you get and send QPL projects to and from your
	repository. If the test is successful, "OK," will be displayed near the top of the
	Command Output window and the first few projects from the repository will be listed.</p>
	
	<p>The QPL Subversion functions expect that your computer's Subversion executable
	file, svn, is included on your computer's path of executable files. If you are using
	Komodo Edit, you will need to add the svn program to your computer's path. If you are
	using Komodo IDE, then you may instead set the location in its Preferences dialog (i.e.,
	Edit &gt; Preferences... &gt; Source Code Control &gt; Subversion &gt; SVN Executable used).</p>
	
	<h2>Working Directory</h2>
	
	<p>Your working directory is where the local copies of your QPL projects will be put when
	you create a new project or get a copy of someone else's project from your Subversion
	repository. You will edit and build your projects in this directory, and then use the
	QPL "Send" command to copy everything back to the repository.</p>
	
	<p>Use the "Browse" button to start a file manager dialog that will let you locate your
	working directory, or create one if necessary. Generally, you will want to locate your
	working directory within your personal user space on your computer (ex. /home/users/larry/qpl in
	Linux).</p>
	
	<h2>JobTracker</h2>
	
	<p>This is a project tracking system used within GAO to keep track of its many
	QPL projects. GAO users should enter the JobTracker URL: https://surveys.gao.gov/jobtracker.
	This is a location on GAO's internal network and so can only be used by GAO employees
	while they are logged into the agency network. If you are not a GAO employee, then you
	should leave this field blank.</p>
	
	<p>Click the "Test" button to check the connection to the JobTracker web site. A dialog
	will pop-up that asks for your JobTracker user name and password. GAO employees who have
	accounts on this system may enter their GAO network user name and SecurID token. If
	successful, "OK," will be displayed near the top of the Command Output pane.</p>
