	<h1>About QPL</h1>

	<p>The Questionnaire Programming Language (QPL) lets you quickly build small or large web based questionnaires by first writing your questions in a QPL script and then using this development system to build all the files needed to create a functioning web-based survey. You can use the development system here to preview your questionnaire as a web page before actually installing it on a web server. Once you are satisfied with your questionnaire (after cycling through a number of edit, compile, review steps), you can build the web server version of your project and install them on a web server where your respondents can access it through the Internet.</p>

	<p>The QPL software supports creating small, one-page questionnaires, or large, multi-page questionnaires. GAO surveys often contain as many as 300 or more items.</p>

	<p>It can be configured to fit a wide variety of survey situations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a respondent may answer anonymously, create an account, or be required to use an established account,</li>
    <li>respondents with accounts may stop and start any number of times until the survey expires,</li>
    <li>a respondent may access one or multiple questionnaires using one account,</li>
    <li>groups of respondents can be established that let a respondent share questionnaires with other respondents in the same group, and</li>
    <li>translations of your questionnaire may be implemented so that respondents can read your questions and write their answers their preferred language.</li>
</ul>

	<p>An email system is also integrated with the questionnaire that lets you easily send a message to each respondent that is customized according to his or her responses to the questionnaire, such as reminder messages to respondents that have not completed the survey. It also can be used to send the survey itself as an email message.</p>

	<p>GAO has used this software to produce over 1300 web questionnaires over the last 14 years to more than half a million respondents, including hundreds of intra-agency data-collection efforts.</p>
