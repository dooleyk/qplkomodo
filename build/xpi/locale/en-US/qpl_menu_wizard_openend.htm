	<h1>Open-Ended Question</h1>

<p>This dialog box may be used to create the QPL code for
one open-ended question. This code will be inserted into your
program at the current cursor position.</p>

<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Name</th>
	<td width="90%" valign="top">The name of a question must start with a letter, contain only letters and numbers, and be from one to sixteen characters long.<br><br>
	If a name is not specified, then a name will be created automatically. (Name will be Q# if visible, U# if visible but not numbered, or H#if not visible.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Stat label</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
If a label is entered here, then this will be used as a variable label for this question when the SAS or SPSS program 
is generated instead of the question text.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Align text</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Define how the question text should be aligned.<br><br>

Left - Left justify question text<br>
Center - Center question text<br>
Right - Right justify question text<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Align question</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Define how the question should be aligned vertically when
used inside a COLUMNS layout. This setting has no effect on questions
in normal or MATRIX layout.<br><br>

Top - Top-align question<br>
Middle - Center-align question<br>
Bottom - Bottom-align question<br>
Baseline - The baseline is the "imaginary line" which most letters "sit" on, in a line of text. 
The baseline value sets the row so that all the table data share the same baseline. Often this 
has the same effect as the bottom value. However, if the fonts are in different sizes, baseline 
looks better.<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Bold text</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set question text to be displayed using a bold font.<br><br>

On - Use bold font.<br>
Off - Do not use bold font<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Bold text</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set question text to be displayed using a bold font.<br><br>

On - Use bold font.<br>
Off - Do not use bold font<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Width</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set the width of the question text area as the number of pixels. 
Leave field blank to inherit this setting from the previous question. Enter &quot;D&quot; to reset the width to the current system default. This value will vary according to whether the question is in a normal, matrix, or columns layout.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Question</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Enter the text of your question here. Each line must be less than 500 characters long. You do not need to be careful where you break your lines; the text will be re-wrapped when it is displayed in the web questionnaire form. You can create a paragraph break by entering a blank line. (See the "Text Line Formatting" section below, and the QPL Help page, "QPL Language Syntax," for additional ways to format your question.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Columns</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set the width of the answer field as the number of text columns (each letter is one column).
Default is 40 columns. Allowed range is 20-100 columns.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Rows</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set the height of the answer field as the number of text rows.
Default is 7 rows. Allowed range is 1-50 rows.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Max characters</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set the maximum number of characters that may be entered into
the answer field. Default is 65535, which is also the maximum
number of characters that may be entered. Minimum number of
characters is 100.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Answer option</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Use this option to specify how many lines of text will be displayed in the input field at one time. By default, if no option is entered here, the input field will show seven lines of text. If the respondent enters more text, a vertical scroll bar will be displayed on the right-side of the input box. The respondent may use this to scroll through the text he has entered. The size of the input box does not limit how much text a respondent may enter. Up to about 65,000 characters may be entered in to the input field, regardless of its height.<br><br>

You may instead use this option to copy your size setting from another open-ended question that you have already written in your questionnaire program. To do this, enter the name of the other open-ended question here.<br><br>

The default answer to an open-ended question is blank. You may, however, preload data into each respondent's open-ended answer. (See the QPL Help page, "Preloading User Accounts and Data," if you want each respondent to see a personalized default answer.)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Next</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Entering the name of a question here will insert a hypertext link to that question at the bottom of this question. The respondent may click on this link to jump to the question, whether or not it happens to be on the same page. No link is created if this left blank.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Display (Define Target)</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Enter a DISPLAY name for this question. You can trigger the display of this question by linking it to an answer in a MULT or CHECK question by entering the DISPLAY command with this name after the answer text in that question. This question will be hidden until the respondent selects that answer on that question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Required</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Check this option to make the answer to this question required. The input field will be displayed on the form with a light pink background if the respondent has not entered an answer. Once the respondent has entered an answer and moved to another question, the light pink background will change to the normal white background.</td>
</tr>
