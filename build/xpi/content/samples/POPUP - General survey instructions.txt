POPUP - General survey instructions.txt

This POPUP text box contains general instructions for operating the
web survey form. In this example, the ^INSTRUCTIONS^ link was used
in the HELP block text, which will appear on the menu bar of the
questinnaire form and on the page that is displayed when a respondent
exits a survey. POPUP links can also be put on the home (HELLO) page
and in the text of a question.
