QUESTION - Recording a DM document number.txt

The following three questions are put into one row of a COLUMNS layout
and are used to capture information about one document that has been
stored in a GAO DM library.

This information may be used in a question on a later page to create
a working link to the document. The respondent may click on the link to
open the document in an appropriate application.

Ex.

\<A HREF\=\"http://dm.gao.gov/?library\=[P3DMLIB]\&doc\=[P3DMNUM], TARGET\=\"\_blank\"\>[P3DMNAME]\</A\>

Note: Blackslashes have been added to preserve QPL special characters. The names
of the questions are used in square brackets. These will be replaced the the
actual data when this is displayed to a respondent, so that the finale link
could look like...

<A HREF="http://dm.gao.gov/?library=GAOHQ&doc=1234567, TARGET="_blank">My Great Document</A>
