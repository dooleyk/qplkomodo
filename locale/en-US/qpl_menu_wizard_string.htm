	<h1>Short Answer Question</h1>

<p>This dialog box may be used to create the QPL code for
one short answer question. This code will be inserted into your
program at the current cursor position.</p>

<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Name</th>
	<td width="90%" valign="top">The name of a question must start with a letter, contain only letters and numbers, and be from one to sixteen characters long.<br><br>
	If a name is not specified, then a name will be created automatically. (Name will be Q# if visible, U# if visible but not numbered, or H#if not visible.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Stat label</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
If a label is entered here, then this will be used as a variable label for this question when the SAS or SPSS program 
is generated instead of the question text.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Align text</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Define how the question text should be aligned.<br><br>

Left - Left justify question text<br>
Center - Center question text<br>
Right - Right justify question text<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Align question</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Define how the question should be aligned vertically when
used inside a COLUMNS layout. This setting has no effect on questions
in normal or MATRIX layout.<br><br>

Top - Top-align question<br>
Middle - Center-align question<br>
Bottom - Bottom-align question<br>
Baseline - The baseline is the "imaginary line" which most letters "sit" on, in a line of text. 
The baseline value sets the row so that all the table data share the same baseline. Often this 
has the same effect as the bottom value. However, if the fonts are in different sizes, baseline 
looks better.<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Bold text</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set question text to be displayed using a bold font.<br><br>

On - Use bold font.<br>
Off - Do not use bold font<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Bold text</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set question text to be displayed using a bold font.<br><br>

On - Use bold font.<br>
Off - Do not use bold font<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Width</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set the width of the question text area as the number of pixels. 
Leave field blank to inherit this setting from the previous question. Enter &quot;D&quot; to reset the width to the current system default. This value will vary according to whether the question is in a normal, matrix, or columns layout.<br><br>
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Question</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Enter the text of your question here. Each line must be less than 500 characters long. You do not need to be careful where you break your lines; the text will be re-wrapped when it is displayed in the web questionnaire form. You can create a paragraph break by entering a blank line. (See the "Text Line Formatting" section below, and the QPL Help page, "QPL Language Syntax," for additional ways to format your question.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Answer option</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Use this option to specify the maximum number of characters that may be typed by the respondent into the short answer field on the web questionnaire form. For example, if you want to limit the respondent's answer to ten characters, you should enter "10" here. (The maximum character setting you may use is limited by the CARD setting at the top of your program file. See the discussion of the CARD command in the QPL Help page, "Short Answer Questions.")<br><br>

You may instead use this option to copy your field size or format setting (see below) from another short answer question that you have already written in your questionnaire program. To do this, enter the name of the other short answer question here. (If you enter the name of another question here, you should not enter a format or default answer below.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Display cols option</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Use this option to specify the maximum number of characters that 
	are visible in the input field. If your field size is greater, then the characters in the box
	will scroll to the left as the respondent types in the input box. If your field size is less
	than this value, the size of the input field will be set to this smaller value.
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Required</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Check this option to make the answer to this question required. The input field will be displayed on the form with a light pink background if the respondent has not entered an answer. Once the respondent has entered an answer and moved to another question, the light pink background will change to the normal white background.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Next</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Entering the name of a question here will insert a hypertext link to that question at the bottom of this question. The respondent may click on this link to jump to the question, whether or not it happens to be on the same page. No link is created if this left blank.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Display (Define Target)</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Enter a DISPLAY name for this question. You can trigger the display of this question by linking it to an answer in a MULT or CHECK question by entering the DISPLAY command with this name after the answer text in that question. This question will be hidden until the respondent selects that answer on that question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Format</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">The format option lets you put a label on the left or right side, or both sides, of the input field on the web questionnaire form. Enter "@" characters to indicate the number of characters that may be entered and any other characters will be your label. (Ex. "@@@@@@@@@@ First name", will create a ten-character input field with the words "First name" immediately to the right.) If you use a format to set your field size, you should not enter a number at the Answer option above to set the field size.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Default</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Normally, the short answer input field defaults to a blank answer. You may enter a different default answer here. All respondents will see the same default answer. (See the QPL Help page, "Preloading User Accounts and Data," if you want each respondent to see a personalized default answer.)</td>
</tr>
