	<h1>Question Information List</h1>

	<p>This dialog lets you create a tab-delimited file that lists information
	about each question in your program. The simplest file only contains the field
	name for each question that is used in the MySQL project data table, and in the
	export data files. Two alternatives may be selected that provide more technical
	details.</p>
	
	<p>These files can be useful when analyzing your data since creating a name for
	a question in QPL is optional. This gives you a handy list of all the names that
	you can use when constructing SQL queries for a Custom Report on the web site,
	or when analyzing your data with SPSS or SAS.</p>
	
	<p>This file is created in your project's "analysis" sub folder, and has the same
	name as your main questionnaire program, but uses an "-info.txt" file name
	extension. Since it is a tab-delimited file, you can open it with Microsoft Excel
	(File &gt; Open as .txt) or LibreOffice Calc (Insert &gt; Sheet from file...), or other
	statistical analysis program. (You can even open it in Microsoft Word, then select
	everything, and convert it into a table!)</p>
