	<h1>Build GAO Product Files</h1>

	<p>This dialog lets you build a collection of files that are used at GAO
	to make web-only summaries of a QPL-based survey. GAO posts these summaries,
	called "e-supplements," in addition to the main audit or evaluation report which
	used the results of the survey.</p>

	<p>Your QPL questionnaire program file (.pg6) must include a PRODUCT block
	that contains various pieces of information that are needed to create the
	e-supplement, including the product title and number, release date, and short
	description of the survey. (See the "GAO Product Block" syntax wizard for
	help programming your PRODUCT block.) </p>

	<p>The final product is created in two stages. First select the option to
	build a special SAS program and then use that to process the fixed-format data
	file (.dat) that you exported from your project web site. This will create
	an output file called "results.htm." This is an HTML file that contains
	a series of tables that summarize each closed-respose (i.e., non-text response)
	in the questionnaire with hypertext links back to the original web questionnaire
	form. This lets an interested reader see how the question was seen by a respondent.</p>

	<p>Second, select the option to build the e-supplement web page files including
	a main page which has your background statement and links to the copy of your
	web questionnaire (which has links to the results.htm file). These files,
	with the results.htm file, will intalled on GAO's public web site with the main
	report when it is officially released. These files will be put in your project's
	"product" subdirectory. You should copy your results.htm file to this directory.</p>
	
	<p>Once all the files are in place, you can use your browser to open the
	the index.htm file in the analysis folder and excercise the e-supplement product.</p>
	
	<h2>Include Links From Questions to Summary Tables</h2>
	<p>Use this option to create hypertext links from each question in the web
	form to the related summary table in the results.htm file. The results.htm
	file will be created using SAS and will include links from each summary table
	back to question. You would un-check this option if you are not including the
	survey results </p>
	
	<h2>Include GAO Reviewer Signature Block</h2>
	<p>This option will include the GAO workpaper documentation block at the top
	of SAS program that is generated that will be used to create the results.htm
	file.</p>
