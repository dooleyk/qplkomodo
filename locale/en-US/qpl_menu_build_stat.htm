	<h1>Build Statistical Analysis Programs</h1>

	<p>This dialog is used to build SAS or SPSS statistical analysis programs
	that read the fixed-format data (.dat) file that a Data Administrator may
	export from the project web site, and create a local system file with
	fully labeled variables and values. The file handling statements in the
	program default to your working project directory location and may need
	to be modified to fit the location where you put this program and the exported
	data file.</p>
	
	<p>First pick the SAS or SPSS option, and then check any of the other options
	to customize how the program will be created. Then click the Build button to
	create the file. This file will be created in the "analysis" folder within
	your projects local working directory. It will have the same file name as your
	main QPL questionnaire program, but will have an .sas or .spc file name extension
	to indicate what type of file it is. The file will also be opened in Komodo.</p>

	<h2>Include Frequency Statistics in Questionnaire Summary</h2>
	<p>In addition to building a system file, you may check this option to also
	include statements to create frequency analysis tables for multiple choice,
	check-all-that-apply, and date answers.</p>


	<h2>Include Descriptive Statistics in Questionnaire Summary</h2>
	<p>This option adds descriptive statistical information for questions which have
	numeric responses.</p>


	<h2>Include Text Responses in Questionnaire Summary</h2>
	<p>This option lists responses made to short answer questions. (Note: Answers
	to open-ended questions are not included in the fixed-format export data (.dat)
	file. Here, the data field here shows number of characters that a respondent
	typed, and so the analysis of these questions is included with the descriptive
	statistics. The open-ended responses may be exported as tab-delimited (.prn)
	or askSam files.)</p>


	<h2>Exclude Hidden Questions in Questionnaire Summary</h2>
	<p>This option can be used to ignore data fields that were programmed as
	hidden questions when the program creates a system file. These are usually
	pre-loaded with respondent-specific information so generally you would
	want to keep them in your system file.</p>


	<h2>Exclude System Variables in Questionnaire Summary</h2>
	<p>In addition to the data fields that hold responses to the question you wrote,
	a number of QPL system variables may also be included when the statistical
	program creates a system file. These include information that could be useful
	in your analysis, such as the internal case identification number, the date
	and time that responses were last made and, if you used a QUESTIONNAIRE question
	to dynamically jump here from another questionnaire, data that details connection
	between the two data records.</p>
	
	<h2>Add Question Numbers to Variable Labels</h2>
	<p>The first 200 or so characters from each question is used in the statistical program
	to label the database variable. Checking this option will also include the automatically
	generated question number that is displayed on the form at the beginning of the
	label.</p>
	
	<h2>Include GAO Review Signature Block</h2>
	<p>This option includes comments at the top of the statistical program file
	that are used to document the program as a GAO work paper, which is used to
	support the agency findings in an audit or program evaluation report.</p>
