	<h1>Help</h1>

	<p>The Questionnaire Programming Language (QPL) has been integrated into
	Komodo as an Add-on application.</p>
	
	<p>You may change the default QPL settings for your operating system,
	Subversion version control repository, and local default working folder
	location using the QPL Preferences dialog: Tools &gt; Add-ons &gt; QPL 6 Wrapper
	&gt; Options (or Preferences). Click the Help button there for more information
	on those settings.</p>
	
	<p>The QPL development software is installed in Komodo's Tools menu:
	Tools &gt; QPL6.
	Here are functions to start a new project, send and get files to and from your version
	control repository, build QPL project web sites using your QPL questionnaire
	program, and use wizards to get help programming your survey questions in the
	QPL language syntax.</p>
	
	<p>A number of the QPL6 menu functions are only available when your QPL program
	file (.pg6) is currently open in a Komodo editing window. These functions will
	perform their actions on the open file. For example, to compile
	your project into a locally viewable web site, you must first open your project
	program file for editing, then from the Komodo menu, select Tools &gt;
	QPL6 &gt; Build &gt;
	Local web site files... This will open a dialog where you may select from a number
	of options to modify how your this QPL program file will be used to create your
	web site. You may click on the Help button on the dialog to see more information
	about the various options.</p>
	
	<p>Most of the QPL menu functions provide useful information about what the
	function did after you executed it in the Komodo Command Output pane. To show
	the Komodo Command Output pane, use View &gt; Tabs &amp; Sidebars
	&gt; Command Output. You may need to scroll backwards in this pane to see all
	of the information.</p>
	
	<p>If you are working as a member of a team, you should use the QPL Subversion
	version control functions to share your project files. A good working process
	should be to first use the function to "Get project files from version control..." to
	to get any changes that someone else may have made to your project (and to lock
	the program file in the repository so that others can not make changes while you
	are working on it). When you have finished an editing session, you should use the
	function to "Send project files to version control..." to reverse this process. Then
	others can depend on the repository containing the most recent version of your
	project (as well as letting you check-out a current copy of your project on a
	different computer, if necessary).</p>
