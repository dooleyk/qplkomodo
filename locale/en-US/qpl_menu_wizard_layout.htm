	<h1>Layout Options</h1>

<p>This dialog box may be used to control how questions are displayed on the page. The
layout commands you select will be inserted in your program at the current cursor
position. You should position the cursor before the first question in your layout when
turning a layout option on, and then after the last question in your layout when
turning a layout option off. Any number of questions may be included inside a 
layout block.</p>

<p>The Normal tab has options that are used to insert page breaks and subtitles, as well
as hide questions. These options may only be used for questions that are not inside a matrix
or columns layout block (that is, questions that are in a Normal layout).</p>

<p>The Matrix tab has options that are used to put one or more questions into a 
horizontal layout. This layout puts the question text on the left and the
answer field(s) on the right, and stacks one or more questions tightly together
to give the appearance of a group of questions.</p>

<p>The Columns tab has options that are used to put two or more questions into
two or columns on the page. Each question still has a vertical layout (the
question text is above the answer field).</p>

<p>The Display tab may be used to control <b>when</b> questions are displayed on the page.
You can use this dialog box to define a group of questions that will be displayed
when a respondent clicks on a MULT or CHECK question answer that is linked to this
group of questions using the DISPLAY command.</p>

<p>The Format options may be used to set the default for questions that are inside
one of these layouts. You may have different defaults for questions in each type
of layout. The defaults will also continue to the next layout block of the same
type. For example, if you set the bold option to on in your first matrix block,
it will still be on when you start another layout block. Thus, you only need to
repeat a format command when you wish to change a default format in a later block.</p>

	<td width="90%" valign="top">Start, stop, or restart a group of one or
	more questions into a column layout. The questions following the start of
	a columns block will be put into rows according to the number of columns
	that have been requested. You must have enough questions to fill out
	the column block completely. For example, if you have 2 columns, you must
	have 2, 4, 6, etc. number of questions in the block. The third, fifth, seventh,
	etc. questions in the list will automatically start a new row.<br /><br /> 

	On - Start putting the following questions into a column block<br /><br />
	
	Off - End the current column block<br /><br />

	# of columns - Set the number of columns that will be used in this block 
	(default is 2 columns, minimum is 2 columns, and maximum is 25 columns).<br /><br />
	
	The width of each column is automatically set by evenly dividing the available
	space among the number of columns used. You may override this behaviour by
	explicitly setting the width inside each question in the first row of questions
	in the block. The total width may not exceed the available space on the 
	the questionnaire form page.

	a heading row at the top of the columns block. <br /><br />
	
	When displayed as an heading
	row, only the text from the first row of questions is displayed. The text from later
	rows of questions is not displayed. This is useful when the question text for a 
	column of questions does not change (ex. each question asks for a value a the same fiscal
	year). You may use a VOID question in the first column to label the row. Unlike the
	other question types, the text of a VOID question is always put in the row and the answer
	label for the first VOID question is used for the column heading.
	 <br /><br /> 

	On - Use the question text from the first row of questions as a header row for
	the column block<br /><br />
	
	Off - Do not use a header row. Each question is displayed normally in its column.<br /><br />

	new column block (This has the effect of re-displaying column headings
	if they are used, and putting a blank row-space between the two matrix

Top - Top-align question<br />

Baseline - The baseline is the "imaginary line" which most letters "sit" on, in a line of text. 
The baseline value sets the row so that all the table data share the same baseline. Often this 
has the same effect as the bottom value. However, if the fonts are in different sizes, baseline 
looks better.<br />

	last question to mark the beginning and end of your target group.<br /><br />

	The triggers and target questions must be used on the same page of your questionnaire form.<br /><br />
	
	DISPLAY groups may be included (i.e., nested) inside of other DISPLAY groups. There is 
	no limit on how deeply groups of questions may be nested. Each DISPLAY group must end with its
	own DISPLAY=OFF command.<br /><br />
	
	Each DISPLAY group must have a unique name, but more than one trigger in a MULT or CHECK 
	may use the same target name. If a target name name is used as a trigger more than once in a MULT
	or CHECK question, then the target will be displayed if <b>any</b> of the duplicate triggers are
	selected by the respondent. The target will be hidden only if <b>none</b> of the duplicate triggers
	are checked. (You should avoid putting triggers to the same target in different MULT or CHECK
	questions as this can lead to ambiguous situations.)<br /><br />

	The action of the triggers on the target blocks can be tested using the local HTML version

Define how questions should be numbered.<br /><br />

On - Start automatic question numbering (default is 1, 2, 3...)<br /><br />

Off - Stop automatic question numbering. The following questions will be un-numbered
until numbering is turned back on. The number will pick up where it left off when
turned back on.<br /><br />

Increment - If the major number is being used, then increment the major number by one 
and reset the minor number to one. Otherwise, just increment the minor number by one.<br /><br />

Start subsection - Turn on automatic major and minor numbering counter. This will
make the current question number the major number and then automatically incrememnt
minor number.<br /><br />

End subsection - Turn off automatic major and minor numbering counter. This will return
numbering to normal question numbering.<br /><br />

Show major # - Display the major number on the questionnaire page with the minor number
(when a major number is used).<br /><br />

Hide major # - Do not display the major number on the questionnaire page with the minor 
number. The major number is still displayed with the minor number in GOTO links, and in
variable labels in SAS and SPSS programs.<br /><br />

Starting #... - Set starting number for the next question. (May be any number or letter.
May also be a number with a major and minor component, such as &quot;1a.&quot; Here,
the questions will be automatically numbered as 1a, 1b, 1c, etc. The major part of the
number does not change until the increment option is used to increase the major
number by one, or when ending a subsection. May use major/minor numbers in the following 
combinations: 1a, 1A, a1, and A1.)<br /><br />
