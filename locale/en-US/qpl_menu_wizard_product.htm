Example<br><br>

This document presents information from a series of structured interviews GAO held with 17 of the 21 U.S. construction firms that won contracts to build new U.S. embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic facilities. Our structured interviews were designed to assess contractor views and experiences on a wide range of construction-related topics, including, (1) experiences working with the Department of State (State), (2) StateÂ’s program-level and onsite construction management policies and processes, (3) incentives for pursuing construction awards, (4) challenges in completing NEC and related construction projects, and (5) profitability of NEC and related projects. We conducted the interviews from May 2008 to June 2008 and all of our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. For a detailed discussion of our scope and methodology, see Embassy Construction: Additional Actions are Needed to Address Contractor Participation   GAO-09-48
