	<h1>Width Calculator</h1>


<p>This dialog box may be used to compute the WIDTH setting for questions
when used in a Normal, MATRIX, or COLUMNS layout.</p>


<p>The WIDTH settings are limited by the PAGEWIDTH, GUTTTER, and MENU settings.
The wizard displays your current settings for these at the top of the calculater.
You may change these settings, but to use them you will also update them in your
questionnaire program. If these values are not explicitly set in your program, the
wizard will display the default values.</p>

<p>Please note that these settings are only suggestions to the respondent's browser.
If the text or input widget will not fit within the space you have set, then the
browser will silently stretch or distort the layout to make things fit. You can tell
that this is occurring if questions with the same settings seem to have different
widths when displayed in a browser window. In this case, you should adjust these
settings so that they are big enough to accomodate your largest items. You should
also provide a little extra space since the elements in your document may have
slightly different measurements when displayed by different browsers.</p>


<h2>Normal Tab</h2>

<p>The Normal tab lets you change the values for the WIDTH and INDENT values. WIDTH
refers to the total horizontal space used to display the question (not including
the question number which is displayed in the GUTTER space). You may use the spin
control to increase the WIDTH to the maxium available with the current PAGEWIDTH,
GUTTER, and MENU settings, or decrease to 1px (though this is not generally very
useful value.)</p>

<p>The INDENT value may be set from 0 to a value less than the current WIDTH setting.
Increasing the value using the spinner control increases the INDENT by one GUTTER
size. Note that the INDENT reduces the space available for the question text and that
the right margin remains at the same location.</p>

<p>The graphic at the bottom shows how all these various measurements interact. The
colored bars will change as you change the various measurements. The blue bar indicates
the width of the MENU (which is always 150 if it is ON), red shows the INDENT,
magenta shos the the GUTTER, and green shows the space available to display your
question text. (This graphic is drawn to 1/4 scale.)</p>

<p>Click the Insert button to insert the WIDTH and INDENT commands into your document
at the current cursor location.</p>

<h2>Matrix Tab</h2>

<p>The MATRIX layout lets you display questions horizontally with the question text
on the left (green) and the answer widgets on the right (cyan). By default, the
available space on the page is divided equally for the text and answers.</p>

<p>The MATRIXWIDTH value defaults to the available width, and may be set to a smaller
value which visually creates a margin on the right side of the page.</p>

<p>The WIDTH setting for the question text may be increased to one-half of the available
question width, or reduced to 1px.</p>

<p>The INDENT setting may be set from 0 to a value less than the current WIDTH setting.
Note here that the INDENT is applied differently than it is in the Normal layout.
Here it is applied <b>after</b> the GUTTER (which holds the question number)
instead of <b>before</b> the question nujmber.</p>

<p>The graphic at the bottom of the tab shows how these various measurements interact.</p>

<p>Clicking the Insert button will insert the MATRIXWIDTH, WIDTH, and INDENT settings
you selected into your questionnaire program at the curren cursor location.</p>


<h2>Columns Tab</h2>

<p>The COLUMNS layout lets you arrange Normal layout questions in individual cells within
rows and columns on the page. By default, the COLUMNS layou will span the available
page space, but not include the GUTTER. (Each Normal question in each cell has its
own GUTTER setting.) So the maximum space available is the PAGEWIDTH minus the MENU
if its used. The WIDTH for each question is divided evenly by the number of COLUMNS.</p>

<p>The COLUMNS setting lets you change the number of columns from 2 to 25 columns.</p>

<p>The WIDTH setting lets you change the width setting for each column. The wizard will
automatically decrease the value as you increase the number of columns. If you decrease
the number columns, the WIDTH is not automatically increased.</p>

<p>The INDENT setting is applied after the MENU (if used). The WIDTH setting is automatically
reduced, if needed, to keep the columns sized to fit within the available space.</p>

<p>Clicking the Insert button will insert the COLUMNS, WIDTH, and INDENT commands with your
values at the current cursor location in your document.</p>

<p>The INDENT setting will be applied to the whole COLUMNS group, and the WIDTH will be used
as the default WIDTH setting for all of the questions in the the group.</p>

<p>Please note that you may further adjust the INDENT and WIDTH settings of each question
in the first row of the COLUMNS layout. The combined values of the WIDTH settings of
the questions in the first must total the available space (i.e., PAGEWIDTH - MENU - INDENT,
or the number of COLUMNS * WIDTH), so you can make some columns wider and some smaller
by taking some amount from one question and giving it to another.</p>

<p>You may also increase the space available for a question if you (1) turn off the question
numbering, and (2) use a negative INDENT for the question. This will widen the space
available to the question text by reducing the amount used for the question number.
Generally, you would only apply these settings after the first column so that its GUTTER
can be used to number the row.</p>

<pre>
.COLUMNS = 3
.INDENT = 35
.WIDTH = 195


--- question 1 ---, WIDTH = 295

.QNUMBERING = OFF

--- question 2 ---, WIDTH = 145, INDENT = -34
--- question 3 ---, WIDTH = 145, INDENT = -34

.QNUMBERING = ON

--- repeat for additional rows

.COLUMNS = OFF
</pre>

<p>In this example, the total available space is 595px (195 * 3). WIDTH settings
have been used inside the first row of questions to change the default WIDTH of 195px.
The first column is widened by adding 100px, and the second and third columns are
narrowed by subtracting 50px, which still results in a total
COLUMNS width of 595px. Negative INDENTs have been used inside the last two questions
to reclaim the space used by the GUTTER to display the question numbers since question
numbering has been turned off.</p>

<p>These WIDTH and INDENT settings do not need to be specified in later rows of questions;
the first row is used so set the column widths and any later settings used within the
COLUMNS block will be ignored. You must, however, use the QNUMBERING command to turn
the question numbering OFF and ON for the questions in the last two columns for each row
as noted above.</p>

<p>The negative INDENT value must be less than the GUTTER size (35 by default).</p>
