	<h1>Build Live Web Site Files</h1>

	<p>This dialog is used to build a version of your questionnaire web site that you install
	on your web server. While you can view the home page (index.htm) file locally since
	it is just an HTML page, the questionnaire form will not be viewable as a web page
	until it is installed on your web server.</p>
	
	<p>If you are creating a multi-language project, all of the language-specific
	questionnaire program files will be listed with selected checkboxes. Generally,
	you should re-compile all of your project files to make sure the generated web
	site files are up-to-date. You may uncheck a program file if you do not want it to
	be used to re-create the related web site files.</p>
	
	<p>The options on this dialog let control how it will build the file that is
	used by project administrators to view summary statistics of the survey
	results. These options are discussed below.</p>
	
	<p>Click the Build button to compile your questionnaire program into a live
	version of your web site. The Command Output pane will list any programming syntax
	errors that occurred which prevented the QPL compiler from creating the web
	site (Note: To show the Komodo Command Output pane, use View &gt; Tabs &amp; Sidebars
	&gt; Command Output.) You may need to scroll back through the information in this
	pane to see all of the syntax error or warning information.</p>

	<p>If your questionnaire program compiles without errors, then your project
	home page will be displayed in a new browser tab in Komodo. (You should still
	review the Command Output pane for any warning messages that you may want
	to correct.) Clicking the "Begin" button, however, will not show your
	questionnaire since it requires web server software to operate correctly.
	You will need to copy all of the files from your working project directory
	to your web server and then run the MySQL file that was generated as part
	of this process to create the database that supports your project. If this is
	successful, you should be able to use your browser to surf to your web site
	location and log in as an administrator or as a respondent using one of the test
	accounts.</p>
	
	<h2>Include Frequency Statistics in Questionnaire Summary</h2>
	<p>Checking this option will cause the Questionnaire Summary Statistics report
	that may be viewed by people who have administrative accounts on your
	project to include tabulations of answers to multiple choice, check-all-that-apply,
	and date questions. The count and percentages are included for each answer
	that was selected by a respondent.</p>
	
	<h2>Include Descriptive Statistics in Questionnaire Summary</h2>
	<p>The sum, low and high values, and average value are included
	count and percentages are included for each question that asks the respondent
	to enter a number.</p>
	
	<h2>Include Text Responses in Questionnaire Summary</h2>
	<p>This option will include answers that a respondent typed on the form in
	response to a short or open-ended questions. Each response will be prefaced with
	the respondent's user name unless the next option below is checked.</p>
	
	<h2>Exclude User Names with Text Responses in Questionnaire Summary</h2>
	<p>If checked, respondent's user names will not be included with responses to
	short or open-ended questions. This may be useful if you want to share these responses
	with others but without identifying who entered the response.</p>

	
	<h2>Include VOID Questions in Questionnaire Summary</h2>
	<p>By default, questions that are only used to display information (i.e., VOID questions)
	are not included in the Questionnaire Summary. In some cases, it may be useful to include
	this information on the Summary in order to more easily interpret the results. Check this
	box to include information-only questions.</p>
	
	<h2>Exclude Hidden Questions in Questionnaire Summary</h2>
	<p>Questions may be hidden in a QPL questionnaire in order to have a place to put information
	about a respondent that you pre-load in the project database. These preloaded answers
	may be displayed to a respondent within the context of one or more other questions (ex.
	"Please tell me about <b>Virginia's</b> bridge re-building program."). Or the data
	may be loaded into the questionnaire record only so that it will be conveniently located
	with the survey responses later when the data is exported from the web site fore statistical
	analysis. It is usually not helpful to list this information in the on-line Questionnaire
	Summary since this report only lists overall questionnaire responses, and not cross-tabulated
	responses.</p>
