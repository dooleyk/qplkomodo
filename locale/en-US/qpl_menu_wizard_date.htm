	<h1>Date Question</h1>

<p>This dialog box may be used to create the QPL code for
one date question. This code will be inserted into your
program at the current cursor position.</p>

<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Name</th>
	<td width="90%" valign="top">The name of a question must start with a letter, contain only letters and numbers, and be from one to sixteen characters long.<br><br>
	If a name is not specified, then a name will be created automatically. (Name will be Q# if visible, U# if visible but not numbered, or H#if not visible.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Stat label</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
If a label is entered here, then this will be used as a variable label for this question when the SAS or SPSS program 
is generated instead of the question text.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Align text</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Define how the question text should be aligned.<br><br>

Left - Left justify question text<br>
Center - Center question text<br>
Right - Right justify question text<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Align question</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Define how the question should be aligned vertically when
used inside a COLUMNS layout. This setting has no effect on questions
in normal or MATRIX layout.<br><br>

Top - Top-align question<br>
Middle - Center-align question<br>
Bottom - Bottom-align question<br>
Baseline - The baseline is the "imaginary line" which most letters "sit" on, in a line of text. 
The baseline value sets the row so that all the table data share the same baseline. Often this 
has the same effect as the bottom value. However, if the fonts are in different sizes, baseline 
looks better.<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Bold text</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set question text to be displayed using a bold font.<br><br>

On - Use bold font.<br>
Off - Do not use bold font<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Bold text</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set question text to be displayed using a bold font.<br><br>

Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Input</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set how the date should be entered by the respondent.<br><br>

<b>yyyy-mm-dd</b> - LDATE - Input field is initially blank. All three parts of the date must be entered if
a date is entered. May be left blank if respondent doesn't have an answer.<br><br>
<b>yyyy-mm-dd (auto)</b> - XDATE - The date the first opens the page with this question is automatically entered.
The respondent may change the date.<br><br>
<b>yyyy-mm</b> - SDATE - Input field is initially blank. Only the year and month may be entered. (The day will 
always be sent to '1' when the date is stored in the database.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Width</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set the width of the question text area as the number of pixels. 
Leave field blank to inherit this setting from the previous question. Enter &quot;D&quot; to reset the width to the current system default. This value will vary according to whether the question is in a normal, matrix, or columns layout.<br><br>
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Question</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Enter the text of your question here. Each line must be less than 500 characters long. You do not need to be careful where you break your lines; the text will be re-wrapped when it is displayed in the web questionnaire form. You can create a paragraph break by entering a blank line. (See the "Text Line Formatting" section below, and the QPL Help page, "QPL Language Syntax," for additional ways to format your question.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Answer option</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">The Answer option is usually left blank since the field size is always set to eight digits. You may use it, however, to copy the default answer (see below) that you have set from a previous question by entering the name of that question here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Next</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Entering the name of a question here will insert a hypertext link to that question at the bottom of this question. The respondent may click on this link to jump to the question, whether or not it happens to be on the same page. No link is created if this left blank.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Display (Define Target)</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Enter a DISPLAY name for this question. You can trigger the display of this question by linking it to an answer in a MULT or CHECK question by entering the DISPLAY command with this name after the answer text in that question. This question will be hidden until the respondent selects that answer on that question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Required</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Check this option to make the answer to this question required. The input field will be displayed on the form with a light pink background if the respondent has not entered an answer. Once the respondent has entered an answer and moved to another question, the light pink background will change to the normal white background.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Default</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Leave this blank if you want the questionnaire input field to default to a blank answer. You may enter a default answer here using the format, "yyyymmdd" (ex. 20060101 is January 1, 2006), to set the default to a particular date. All respondents will see the same default answer. (See the QPL Help page, "Preloading User Accounts and Data," if you want each respondent to see a personalized default answer.)<br><br>

<b>Default to today's date</b>. Check this box if you want the date in respondent's questionnaire to default to the date he first viewed that page. (Note: This only occurs the first time a respondent views the page. If he opens it again on another day, the date will not be changed. Also, as with the normal date question, the respondent may change the date.) If you check this option, then you should not enter anything into the Default field above.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Instruction Line</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">The INSTRUCTION command may be used to override the default date instruction line.<br>
	ON - Use default instruction line.<br>
	OFF - Do not use an instruction line.<br>
	"new instruction" - Use this new phrase as an instruction line.

</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Output attributes on a single line</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">This does not do anything.</td>
