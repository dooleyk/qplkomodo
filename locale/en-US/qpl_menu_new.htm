	<h1>Create New QPL Project</h1>

	<p>Use this dialog to create a new web questionnaire project.</p>
	<p>It will create a new folder (i.e., file directory) inside the local working
	directory that you set in the <a href="preferences.htm">QPL Preferences</a> dialog.
	Then it will copy the standard QPL program files (which provide basic functionality
	for the questionnaire and administrative parts of your web survey web site) to
	this location, and create QPL script file which is the start of your questionnaire.
	This file will have the project name you specify in this dialog and have a ".pg6"
	file name extension. Use the QPL "Build" menu functions to convert this file
	into a web questionnaire, or a statistical analysis program that you can use to
	analyze your web survey data.</p>
	
	<p>If you have defined a Subversion version control repository in your
	QPL Preferences, you may also use the option to import your project to that
	repository.</p>
	
	<p>This same option will also create a new QPL JobTracker project documentation
	record for you if this has been set in the QPL Preferences. The project will
	have the same short title that you use here, and the survey file name and version
	control names will filled in with your project name.</p>
	
	<h2>Short Project Title</h2>
	
	<p>This title will be used to label your QPL questionnaire script (.pg6 file) and
	to name your project in JobTracker, GAO's web survey project tracking web site.
	This title is not used to label your project's questionnaire or web site home
	page.</p>
	
	<h2>Project File Name</h2>
	
	<p>This file file name is used for a number things. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Name of your questionnaire program (.pg6) file,</li>
		<li>Name of your project's folder (i.e., file directory) in your local
		QPL working directory,</li>
		<li>Name of your project's version control folder,</li>
		<li>Name of the MySQL database that will store your respondent data on the web server, and</li>
		<li>Name of your SAS or SPSS analysis programs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The file name must start with a letter and only contain letters and numbers,
	and be no more than 16 characters long. It also can not be the same name as
	another project that is already running on your web server (since MySQL does not
	allow two different databases to have the same name.)</p>
	
	<h2>Languages</h2>
	<p>If you will be providing your questionnaire in more than one language, you may
	pick the languages that your questionnaire will be translated into. A QPL script file
	will be created for each language you select. Here, the .pg6 file name extension will
	be further extended with the standard 2-letter abbreviation for that language. The
	name of the language will also be added to each QPL program file, as well as sample
	HTML code to the home page that will let respondents toggle between the various
	translations that you provide.</p>
	
	<p>Special care must be taken so that each translation maps to the same answer list.
	That is, each project should create the same database record layout, with the same
	field names and attributes. Each of the web questionnaire translation forms will
	all use the same MySQL database to record the responses.</p>
	
	<p>If you will only be creating your questionnaire using <b>one</b> language (English or
	something else), then you should not check any of the language boxes.</p>
	
	<p>See TODO for more information about creating a questionnaire with multiple translations</p>
	
	<h2>Version Control and JobTracker</h2>
	<p>This option will be enabled if you have defined a Subversion repository in your QPL
	Preferences. If this is checked, then your project will be added to the repository
	after it creates it locally in your QPL working folder. If you are using version control,
	then you should routinely use the QPL version control functions to "send" all your
	changes to the repository when you are not working on it, and "get" any changes that
	someone else may have made to your project before you resume working on it. The
	QPL source program file (.pg6) will be "locked" when you have it checked out for editing.
	This prevents someone else from checking it out and making changes at the same
	time. You must send the files back to the repository before someone else can get
	your updated files. See TODO for more information about checking files in and out
	of version control.</p>
	<p>JobTracker is GAO's web-based project tracking system, so its not available to
	people outside GAO. If it is defined in your QPL Preferences, then you will be asked
	to enter your GAO network user name and SecurID token to log in. Once you do, a
	new JobTracker record will be created with your short project title and project
	file name filled in. You will need to go to this web site later to enter more information
	about your project including the target URL, log in options, and administrator accounts.</p>
