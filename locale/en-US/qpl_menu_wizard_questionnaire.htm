	<h1>Questionnaire Question</h1>

<p>This dialog box may be used to create the QPL code for
to create a question that links your questionnaire to a second questionnaire.
This code will be inserted into your
program at the current cursor position.</p>

<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Name</th>
	<td width="90%" valign="top">The name of a question must start with a letter, contain only letters and numbers, and be from one to sixteen characters long.<br><br>
	If a name is not specified, then a name will be created automatically. (Name will be Q# if visible, U# if visible but not numbered, or H#if not visible.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Stat label</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
If a label is entered here, then this will be used as a variable label for this question when the SAS or SPSS program 
is generated instead of the question text.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Align text</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Define how the question text should be aligned.<br><br>

Left - Left justify question text<br>
Center - Center question text<br>
Right - Right justify question text<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Align question</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Define how the question should be aligned vertically when
used inside a COLUMNS layout. This setting has no effect on questions
in normal or MATRIX layout.<br><br>

Top - Top-align question<br>
Middle - Center-align question<br>
Bottom - Bottom-align question<br>
Baseline - The baseline is the "imaginary line" which most letters "sit" on, in a line of text. 
The baseline value sets the row so that all the table data share the same baseline. Often this 
has the same effect as the bottom value. However, if the fonts are in different sizes, baseline 
looks better.<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Bold text</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set question text to be displayed using a bold font.<br><br>

On - Use bold font.<br>
Off - Do not use bold font<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Bold text</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set question text to be displayed using a bold font.<br><br>

On - Use bold font.<br>
Off - Do not use bold font<br>
Inherit - Inherit setting from the previous question
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Width</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">
Set the width of the question text area as the number of pixels. 
Leave field blank to inherit this setting from the previous question. Enter &quot;D&quot; to reset the width to the current system default. This value will vary according to whether the question is in a normal, matrix, or columns layout.<br><br>
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Question</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Enter the text of your question here. Each line must be less than 240 characters long. You do not need to be careful where you break your lines; the text will be re-wrapped when it is displayed in the web questionnaire form. You can create a paragraph break by entering a line which has only one blank space at the beginning of the line. (See the QPL Help page, "QPL Language Syntax," for additional ways to format your question.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Answer option</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">By default, the last answer in your list of answers will be checked when the web questionnaire installed on a web server. You may use this option, however, to change the default to another answer. To do this,enter the number of the other answer here. The first answer, for example would be "1." <br><br>

You may instead use this option to copy the list of answers from another multiple choice question that you have already written in your questionnaire program, including the default answer specification. To do this, enter the name of the other multiple choice question here. (If you enter the name of another question here, you should not enter any answers below.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Next</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Entering the name of a question here will insert a hypertext link to that question at the bottom of this question. The respondent may click on this link to jump to the question, whether or not it happens to be on the same page. No link is created if this left blank.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Display (Define Target)</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Enter a DISPLAY name for this question. You can trigger the display of this question by linking it to an answer in a MULT or CHECK question by entering the DISPLAY command with this name after the answer text in that question. This question will be hidden until the respondent selects that answer on that question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Required</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Check this option to make the answer to this question required. The input field will be displayed on the form with a light pink background if the respondent has not entered an answer. Once the respondent has entered an answer and moved to another question, the light pink background will change to the normal  background color.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">URL</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Set the location of the target questionnaire on the web server. If both questionnaires are located on the same web server in different directories, just the name of the target directory may be used. (Ex. If the two projects are located at http://www.mydomain.com/project1 and http://www.mydomain.com/project2, then the target may be specified here as &quot;project2.&quot; If hosted on different locations, then the full URL to the directory location must be used.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Database</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">Set the name of the target questionnaire's database. This name is taken from the target questionnaire's QPL program file name. For example, &quot;myproject.pgm&quot; will have a database name of &quot;myproject.&quot;
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Status clause</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">This may be used to indicate the status of a case in the target questionnaire. This must be an SQL expression that results in a true or false value, such as &quot;FINISH = 1,&quot; where FINISH is the name of question and 1 is its value when a user answers that question to say he has finished that questionnaire. If an expression has been defined and it evaluates to a true value, then the link to it will be displayed in the source questionnaire using bold type.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<th width="10%" valign="top" align="left">Instruction Line</th>
	<td valign="top" align="left">The INSTRUCTION command may be used to override the default QUESTIONNAIRE instruction line (228).<br>
	ON - Use default instruction line.<br>
	OFF - Do not use an instruction line.<br>
	"new instruction" - Use this new phrase as an instruction line.
